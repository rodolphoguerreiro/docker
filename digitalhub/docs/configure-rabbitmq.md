Make sure you have executed the command `bin/dev setup` to configure RabbitMQ credentials.

To access the RabbitMQ Management, just access from browser: http://rabbitmq.localhost (use our username and password configured in `conf/rabbitmq` to access).

If you have any question, access the [Official Repository][1]
